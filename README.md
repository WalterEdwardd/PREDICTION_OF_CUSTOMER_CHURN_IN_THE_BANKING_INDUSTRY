Tools used: PowerPoint, Excel, Visual Studio Code

## Problem Statement
Customer retention is as crucial as customer acquisition when it comes to increasing revenue. Also we know, it is much more expensive to sign in a new client than keeping an existing one.

It is advantageous for banks to know what leads a client towards the decision to leave the company. Also churn prediction allows companies to develop loyalty programs and retention campaigns to keep as many customers as possible so we have 3 tasks:
1. Analyze the customer churn rate for bank because it is useful to understand why the customers leave.
2. Predictive behavior modeling i.e. to classify if a customer is going to churn or not.
3. Choose the most reliable model that will attach a probability to the churn to make it easier for customer service to target right customer in order to minimize their efforts to prevent churn.

## Goals of the Study
1.	To apply data preprocessing and preparation techniques in order to obtain clean data (EDA).
2.	To build machine learning models able to predict bank churn based on customer features.
3.	To analyze and compare models performance in order to choose the best model.

- Customers with low credit scores (below 400) often tend to leave, banks should give recommendations so customers can improve their credit scores, including making specific suggestions such as spending reasonable, repay on time and maintain a positive credit history.
- Germany is the country with the highest churn rate (33%), further research is needed to better understand the causes of high customer churn rates in Germany, due to service not meeting expectations, spending High fees, fierce competition, or poor customer support,... then take appropriate measures to reduce the churn rate.
- Women are a group of customers with a higher tendency to leave banks than men. Further research may be needed to better understand the causes, thereby developing customized customer care products and services suitable for each gender, especially female customers.
- Customers with high balance (over 200k) and low balance (under 50k) often tend to leave. Maybe the products and services are not suitable for these two customer groups. Banks should increase communication and personalized consulting to better understand each customer's needs and financial goals, helping the bank provide more suitable financial solutions and products. For example, for customers with high balance, banks can recommend investment packages or high-yield assets. For customers with low balance, flexible savings products or suitable credit packages can be provided.
- Customers who use more products have higher retention rates. To reduce the customer churn rate, banks can focus on enhancing customer experience, promoting consulting and providing information about products, offering combined product packages, and promotional programs. attractive to increase the number of products used.
- Active customer activity is an important factor that helps banks retain customers. Banks need to create interactive activities, provide attractive incentive information, and design flexible and convenient products and services. Regularly contact and interact with inactive customers to create close relationships, this can be via email, phone, text messages, etc. Creating a personal connection can be an important factor. so that customers feel excited, and come back to use your services.
- Customers aged 46 to 75 years old have a high churn rate (45%), which may reflect the changing trend in customer needs and priorities with age. Banks can focus on developing products and services that suit the needs and priorities of each age group. Especially from 46 to 75 years old.
- New customers are a group of customers with a higher churn rate when compared to other groups. Banks need to create a welcoming and supportive environment, and offer attractive product and service packages, especially in the early stages when customers are new to using the bank's services. This helps customers want to stick with the bank for a long time, and increases customer loyalty to the bank.
