# PREDICTION_OF_CUSTOMER_CHURN_IN_THE_BANKING_INDUSTRY
Tools used: PowerPoint, Excel, Visual Studio Code

## Problem Statement
Customer retention is as crucial as customer acquisition when it comes to increasing revenue. Also we know, it is much more expensive to sign in a new client than keeping an existing one.

It is advantageous for banks to know what leads a client towards the decision to leave the company. Also churn prediction allows companies to develop loyalty programs and retention campaigns to keep as many customers as possible so we have 3 tasks:
1. Analyze the customer churn rate for bank because it is useful to understand why the customers leave.
2. Predictive behavior modeling i.e. to classify if a customer is going to churn or not.
3. Choose the most reliable model that will attach a probability to the churn to make it easier for customer service to target right customer in order to minimize their efforts to prevent churn.

## Goals of the Study
1.	To apply data preprocessing and preparation techniques in order to obtain clean data (EDA).
2.	To build machine learning models able to predict bank churn based on customer features..
3.	To analyze and compare models performance in order to choose the best model.
